# Dataset Limitations

## Source
- Dataset: [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) (via Fitabase, 2016).
- License: CC0 Public Domain (free to use).

## Sample Size
- 30 users only.
- Volunteer-based sample (Mechanical Turk participants).
- May not represent the diversity of Bellabeat’s AFAB target market.

## Demographics
- No detailed demographic info provided (age, gender identity, location, etc.).
- Cannot segment insights by key groups (e.g., women, AFAB, age ranges).

## Time Period
- March 12 – May 12, 2016 (two months).
- Outdated — behaviors may not reflect current wearable usage.

## Scope of Data
- Tracks **outputs** (steps, calories burned, intensity, sleep, heart rate).
- Does not include **inputs** (calories consumed, nutrition, sugar intake).
- Sparse weight/BMI logs.
- Sleep data is only available for the April–May 2016 set, not March–April 2016 set. 
- Analysis will be limited to one month for sleep insights.

## ROCCC Assessment
- **Reliable:** Yes (real Fitbit devices).
- **Original:** Yes (direct export from Fitabase).
- **Comprehensive:** No (limited users, missing nutrition).
- **Current:** No (collected in 2016).
- **Cited:** Yes (public Kaggle source).

## Key Blind Spot
- The dataset shows how much energy users burn but **not how much they consume**.  
- This makes it impossible to assess whether users are in caloric balance.  
- Missing nutrition (especially sugar intake) is a critical limitation for wellness insights.
